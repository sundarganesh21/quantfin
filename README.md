# Quant Research Portfolio

This is my public research notebook for quantitative finance. 
It contains small, self-contained projects demonstrating statistical modeling, market microstructure, and trading strategies. 
Each project includes data, methodology, reproducible code, and a brief discussion of results.
This is a companion respository for my [personal github page](sundarganesh21.github.io), where each strategy/analysis is discussed in further detail.
