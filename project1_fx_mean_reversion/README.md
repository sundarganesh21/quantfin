This project looks at implementing a moving average algorithm for a mean-reverting FX rate. First, we study whether the FX rate is indeed mean reverting and, if so, what the mean-reversion half-life is. After establishing that the signal is indeed mean reverting, we then propose a simple Z-score algorithm to trade the signal, leading to annualized returns of 28% and a Sharpe ratio of 1.8 during backtesting.
